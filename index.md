## What is Scratux?
Scratux is a simple project that aims to provide Free/Libre Open Source Linux binaries of [Scratch Desktop](https://scratch.mit.edu/download). So consider it as the unofficial Scratch for Linux ;)

Since the official Scratch project does not provide binaries for Linux distributions, we created this project so you do not have to download + build from source. Just click and install it.

Scratux is built-in different languages and is always based on the latest Scratch release. (Currently Scratch 3.0)

### Build your own

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/scratux/scratux.git
